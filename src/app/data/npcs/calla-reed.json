	"name": "Calla Reed",
	"race": "Half-elf",
	"role": "Village Healer",
	"appearance": "Calla is a slender half-elf in her early 40s, with smooth pale skin touched by freckles and a graceful posture that seems effortless. Her long silver hair is kept in neat braids, practical for work but beautiful in its own right, and her gentle green eyes carry warmth and reassurance. She dresses in simple healer's robes of soft linen, with an apron often smudged with herbs and poultices. Her hands are steady, practiced, and smell faintly of lavender and thyme.",
	"description": "Compassionate and patient, Calla has the calming presence of a steady river. She speaks softly and rarely raises her voice, even under pressure. She avoids conflict where she can, believing her role is to mend rather than to harm. While gentle, she is not fragile â€” her quiet determination and unyielding care have saved more lives in Eldrin's Hollow than most know. She treats everyone with dignity, whether tending to a scraped knee or a festering wound, and often becomes a quiet confidante to those who come to her.",
