    <app-text-image-section title="The Third Age of Evros" imgPath="/evros.jpg" [reversed]="true">
        <p>The world of <em>Evros</em> now stands in the year 3176 of the Third Age, an age marked by fragile alliances, fading empires, and looming threats. Kingdoms and free cities cling to old traditions while whispers of change stir in every corner of the land. Magic hums faintly in the bones of the world, but so too does a new kind of fear.</p>

        <p>From the south rises the <em>Psyrenthian Dominion</em>, a force unlike any Evros has ever known. Rumours say their armies march not by steel and flame alone, but with the power to ensnare the very minds of those who oppose them. Some speak of whole cities bending the knee overnight, their leaders turned into hollow puppets of the Dominion's will. Others dismiss these tales as hearsay, but with every passing year, the Dominion's reach grows wider, and its shadow creeps closer.</p>

        <p>Yet in the north-west, destiny stirs. A great turning lies close at hand, a single event whose reverberations will not only decide the course of the waning Third Age, but lay the very cornerstone of the Fourth. What unfolds here will not be forgotten — for it shall shape the fate of Evros for ages beyond counting.</p>

    <app-text-image-section title="The Scholar's Call" imgPath="/eryndor.jpg" [xPos]="55">
        <p><em>Eryndor Thalorien</em> was once the steady compass of the adventuring company. A quiet but brilliant scholar, he had an insatiable curiosity for the heavens above and the ancient mysteries below. Though not the loudest voice at the campfire nor the first to charge into battle, he earned his place among the group with his wisdom, calm reasoning, and a knack for uncovering forgotten knowledge in dusty tomes and shattered ruins.</p>

        <p>When the group eventually drifted apart, Eryndor returned to a quieter life. He settled in the small village of <em>Eldrin's Hollow</em>, where the skies were clear and nights long—perfect for his stargazing. Though he lived among the villagers, his heart was always tied to his companions, the ones who shared so many battles, triumphs, and late-night stories by the fire.</p>

        <p>Recently, his studies revealed the coming of a rare celestial event: a sweeping meteor shower. To Eryndor, it felt like more than a marvel of the heavens—it felt like a sign, and more importantly, an opportunity.</p>

        <p>And so, for the first time in years, Eryndor has reached out to his old friends—the companions who once trusted their lives to each other. With the night of the falling star drawing near, he hopes to gather them in Eldrin's Hollow, not just to share in the wonder of the skies, but to face whatever destiny the heavens may bring.</p>

    <app-text-image-section title="Eldrin's Hollow" imgPath="/eldrins-hollow.jpg" [reversed]="true">
        <p>Nestled on the edge of the <em>Whispering Forest</em> and south of the <em>Stormcradle Range</em>, the simple <em>Eldrin's Hollow</em> is a quiet, unassuming village that most travelers would pass without a second glance. But to those who linger, it is a place of warmth, wonder, and quiet magic.</p>

        <p>The Hollow is best known for its clear night skies. Generations of villagers have gathered on the hillsides to watch the stars wheel overhead, sharing stories, songs, and dreams beneath the heavens. Local lore says that the stars themselves favor the Hollow, and sometimes, if one watches closely, they even fall to earth.</p>

        <p>Life here is simple. Cobblestone paths wind between moss-covered cottages, the air carries the scent of baked bread and woodsmoke, and the laughter of children echoes through the fields. The tavern, <em>The Starlit Hearth</em>, is the beating heart of the village, where strangers become friends and where every tale eventually finds its way into song.</p>

        <p>Though Eldrin's Hollow is small, its people are proud and resilient. And when the skies stir with strange omens every soul in the Hollow knows that destiny has a way of finding even the quietest corners of the world.</p>

    <app-text-image-section title="The Adventure Awaits" imgPath="/adventure.jpg" [xPos]="25" [reversed]="true">
        <p>You aren't strangers meeting for the first time — far from it. Your characters once walked the same path, part of a single adventuring band bound by trust, laughter, and a few scars. Together, you carved your names into the memories of this land.</p>

        <p>But three years ago, that unity fractured. Whether through clashing ideals, old wounds, or the weight of what you faced, the group drifted apart. Some parted on warm terms, others less so, but all carried away the same truth: those bonds never fully broke, only stretched thin.</p>

        <p>Now fate pulls you back together. The world may see you as individuals arriving in Eldrin's Hollow, but you know better — this is a reunion. Every shared glance, every recalled memory, every unfinished sentence is a reminder: once, you were one.</p>

        <p>This adventure begins not with strangers learning each other's names, but with old companions rediscovering who they are when they stand side by side once more.</p>

        <p>The truths beyond the veil — what you, the players, should know before setting foot in this story.</p>

        <h4>Format & Scope</h4>
        <p>This is a 6-session revolver campaign designed to be self-contained. Characters will begin at Level 7, as seasoned adventurers stepping into the prime of their careers.</p>

        <h4>Character Creation Notes</h4>
        <p>This adventure focuses on a turning point of history of Evros. While your heroes' choices will absolutely shape events, there won't be much time for backstories to take center stage. Instead, your characters are swept into the tide of a moment whose weight will echo through the ages.</p>
        
        <p>This shouldn't discourage you from being creative with your backstory, just remember that the 3rd Age is barely fleshed out. But this just means that we have a chance to work together on something that influences the 4th Age and might even show up in our main campaign.</p>

        <p>You are more encouraged to discuss with your fellow players how your characters behaved with one another and what memories they had together.</p>

        <h4>Starting Gear</h4>
        <p>Characters will start with their regular starting gear as well as the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>600 GP for improved armour & weapons</li>
            <li>1 Uncommon & 1 Rare Magic Items</li>
            <li>Additional Magic Items are available for purchase, but they won't be cheap.</li>
            <li>As usual, don't forget about <a href="https://5e.tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5etools</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Tone & Style</h4>
        <p>This adventure will focus on mystery and investigation. Most of the adventure will be spent in a forest away from civilisation. Combat & Exploration will be the main two pillars of play, but Roleplay will still be important in certain situations.</p>

    <app-text-image-section title="Rumours & Secrets" imgPath="/secrets.jpg" [reversed]="true">
        <p>In Eldrin's Hollow, whispers travel faster than the wind. Each player will receive a handful of rumours about the wider world—and perhaps even about their fellow adventurers. Whether these rumours are truths, half-truths, or outright lies will remain for you to discover at the table. You may choose to share them… or let them fester in silence.</p>

        <p>As such, each player must create four rumours about their own character. Some may be scandalous, others mysterious, and a few entirely fabricated. These portray how you all kept tabs on each other and how accurately you were able to. They will be distributed to the other players or kept for the DM to toy with as I see fit. </p>
